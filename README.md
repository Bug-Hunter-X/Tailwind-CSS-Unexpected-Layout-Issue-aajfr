# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Layout Issue

This repository demonstrates a strange layout problem encountered when using Tailwind CSS.  A simple component exhibits unexpected behavior, with elements not rendering as expected.  The issue is likely caused by a subtle interaction between Tailwind classes or a conflict with other CSS.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution (if found). 

## Problem

The component in `bug.js` displays unexpected layout. The cause might be due to class conflicts, incorrect class usage or a more complex Tailwind interaction issue.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` resolves this layout problem and shows the expected layout. The solution might include:

* Identifying and resolving conflicting classes
* Correcting class usage and order
* Adding necessary classes for proper layout.
* Using Tailwind's debugging tools to identify the root cause.
